Modern Safeguarding vs Ancient Law — Comparative Matrix

Scope:
Comparative overview of practices involving children in Ancient Near Eastern law codes (e.g., Hammurabi), the Hebrew Bible, and the Qurʾān / early Islamic legal context, contrasted with modern UK safeguarding law and international child-protection standards (e.g., UN Convention on the Rights of the Child — UNCRC).

Note:
This describes historical legal assumptions reflected in texts, not contemporary religious practice or interpretation.

Comparative Matrix

Practice Involving Children	ANE Law Codes (e.g., Hammurabi)	Hebrew Bible	Qurʾān / Early Islamic Context	Modern UK Safeguarding & UNCRC Standard
Child slavery / debt servitude	Explicitly permitted; hereditary status	Permitted within household economy (Exod 21; Lev 25)	Acknowledged; manumission encouraged	Illegal — Modern Slavery Act 2015
Sale of children by parents	Allowed under debt law	Daughter sold as servant (Exod 21:7)	Guardianship emphasised	Illegal — child trafficking / exploitation offences
Child labour / economic servitude	Bonded labour common	Household labour integration	Household economic roles	Strict limits; education priority
Marriage of minors / child betrothal	Early arranged marriage standard	No fixed minimum age; puberty assumptions	No explicit minimum age historically	Illegal under 18 — Marriage and Civil Partnership Act 2022
Forced marriage	Family contractual control	Parental authority central	Guardian roles historically significant	Criminal offence — Forced Marriage Act 2007 / Serious Crime Act 2015
Sexual access tied to ownership	Not prohibited in codes	Concubinage frameworks present	Historically linked to slave ownership in juristic tradition	Rape / child sexual exploitation offences
Corporal punishment by parents	Severe patriarchal discipline	Physical discipline endorsed proverbially	Limited discipline in later legal tradition	Highly restricted; abuse offences apply
Extreme punishment for disobedience	Harsh penalties incl. mutilation	Rebellious son law (Deut 21)	No direct Qurʾānic equivalent	Illegal; safeguarding intervention required
Infanticide / child killing	Varied practices	Child sacrifice condemned; violent narratives exist	Infanticide explicitly condemned	Murder; safeguarding protections
Child autonomy / consent	Minimal legal autonomy	Strong parental control	Guardianship structures	“Best interests of the child” — UNCRC Art. 3
Education vs labour	Apprenticeship priority	Family-based training	Moral/household training	Compulsory education laws
Property rights of orphans	Adoption/inheritance regulated	Widow/orphan protections	Strong orphan property protections	Legal guardianship oversight; financial abuse offences

Key Analytical Notes
	•	Structural difference:
Ancient systems treat children primarily as dependents within patriarchal households; modern safeguarding treats children as independent rights-holders.
	•	Economic drivers:
Debt, labour, and marriage alliances heavily shaped child treatment historically.
	•	Violence thresholds:
Corporal punishment and extreme penalties were socially accepted in many ancient contexts; modern UK law treats physical harm as abuse except within very narrow legal limits.
	•	Relative reforms (historical context):
	•	Hebrew Bible: prohibitions on child sacrifice.
	•	Qurʾān: explicit condemnation of infanticide; strong orphan protection.
	•	ANE codes: structured adoption/apprenticeship regulation (though still hierarchical).
	•	Modern absolute prohibitions:
	•	Child slavery or sale
	•	Under-18 or forced marriage
	•	Sexual access via guardianship/ownership
	•	Severe corporal punishment
	•	Economic exploitation
